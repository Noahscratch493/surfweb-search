# SurfWeb - Clean Google Search

SurfWeb is a minimalist, privacy-focused search engine that leverages Google’s Custom Search Engine (CSE) to provide a clean, ad-free, and tracker-free search experience. Unlike the traditional Google search page, SurfWeb eliminates tracking mechanisms, ads, and unnecessary clutter, ensuring your search privacy and experience is prioritized.

## Features

- **No Trackers**: SurfWeb removes all the unnecessary tracking parameters from Google URLs, ensuring that no data is shared with third parties or used for targeted advertising.
- **No Ads**: Ads are completely stripped from the search results. You get the results without any distractions or intrusive advertising.
- **Privacy-Focused**: With no tracking cookies or data collection, SurfWeb ensures your search activity is private and not used for profiling.
- **Minimalist Interface**: A simple, user-friendly interface that gets straight to the search results. No flashy designs, just pure functionality.
- **Clean Google Search**: SurfWeb uses Google’s powerful search engine through a Custom Search Engine (CSE) integration, but without the tracking and ads. You get the search quality of Google without the bloat.

## How It Works

SurfWeb utilizes Google’s Custom Search Engine (CSE) API to provide search results directly from Google. However, unlike the traditional Google search page, we strip all tracking parameters, ads, and third-party data collection methods.

- **Custom Search Engine (CSE)**: By integrating Google’s CSE, SurfWeb can harness the power of Google's search algorithms and return relevant results, but without the usual tracking, ads, and other privacy concerns that come with the standard Google experience.
- **Privacy by Design**: All trackers, including cookies, referral data, and query parameters like `sourceId` and `RLZ`, are removed, ensuring that your searches are not tracked or stored by Google.
